## Contents

This repository contains the following materials:

- **Quarto Markdown Files**: Source files for each chapter of the book, such as `intro.qmd`, `simulation_basics.qmd`, and `optimization_basics.qmd`.
- **Python Code**: Example scripts and implementations for simulation and optimization techniques, located in the `code/` directory.
- **Figures**: TikZ and LaTeX files for generating figures, organized by chapter in the `figures/` directory.
- **HTML Outputs**: Pre-rendered HTML files for each chapter, available in the `docs/` directory.
- **References**: Bibliographic references in `references.bib` and `references.qmd`.

## How to Use

1. **View the Book**: The book is rendered as a website. Open the `docs/index.html` file in your browser to navigate the chapters.
2. **Run Code Examples**: Navigate to the `code/` directory and execute Python scripts to explore simulation and optimization techniques.
3. **Generate Figures**: Use the TikZ and LaTeX files in the `figures/` directory to recreate or modify figures.
4. **Edit Content**: Modify the `.qmd` files to update the book's content. Use Quarto to render the changes.

## Requirements

To work with this repository, you need:

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for rendering `.qmd` files.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.8 or higher) for running code examples.
- LaTeX distribution (e.g., [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)) for generating figures.
